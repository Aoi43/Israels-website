  <p>About Me And My Art </p>
  <p>Hello my name is Israel and i first started drawing as a little kid as most people, Like many others i grew up
    drawing super heros and cartoons, video games, etc. Every kid drew diffrent characters however i drew two characters
    mostly, Those two characters were Sonic The Hedghog and Spider-Man</p>

<p>Spider-Man</p>

<p>As most kids i grew up watching Spider-Man and well i would draw a lot as a kid and since i would watch Spider-Man a
  lot i began to draw him. Not long after that's all i would draw just Spider-Man and sometime other super hero's and
  well they weren't good drawing's but i was a little kid and i would just draw becuase i enjoyed it. The reason why
  Spider-Man is even on this page is becuase Spider-Man is a big reason why i started to draw a lot as a kid and even
  now i still enjoy drawing Spider-Man, Drawing him helps me practice drawing the human body and learn how to work on
  color's and enjoy drawing My favorite character, And is a big reason why i still enjoy drawing. </p>
<p>Sonic the Hedghog</p>

<p>In Elementary school i would only draw Spider-Man but then one day i was watching youtube and then i saw a sonic toy
  video after that i started to watch more sonic videos and then i started to draw him at first it was hard and diffrent
  but i got the hang of it pretty fast. Something i liked about drawing sonic besides being a fan was how simple his
  design was and how i found it easy to draw.All through out elementary i would only be drawing sonic and well as a kid
  i wanted a sonic toy but at the time i didn't have it so i got a bit creative. What i started to do was draw the sonic
  characters i wanted and i would cut them out and color them and play with them like toys, Seeing how i could make my
  own "custom toys" i started to try and get better so i could make more and i got "good" well in elementary terms.But
  as i grew up i drew less and less but when i would draw it would be sonic but i stoped drawing for a while.However in
  december of 2020 i got covid-19, and i was stuck in my room with nothing to do i was playing a lot of sonic video
  games and i thought maybe i should draw again and i started drawing more agian , i woulld only draw sonic characters
  but i was finally drawing agian as i remembered how much i enjoyed drawing i started to leanrn more , Sonic the
  hedghog brought my love for art back. </p>
